# 2048 2600 — Dev Diary

Day 4 of AItari 2600, and I went with something completely different from the first three. No physics, no projectiles, no real-time action — just a pure puzzle game. 2048.

## Why 2048?

After three action games (Pong, Breakout, Asteroids), I wanted to prove this project isn't just about twitchy reflexes. 2048 is elegant — dead simple rules, surprising depth, and that addictive "one more try" loop. Plus, adapting a modern puzzle game to an Atari 2600 aesthetic felt like a fun clash of eras.

## The Retro Challenge

The interesting design tension: 2048 is inherently a *modern* game (2014!), so there's no actual Atari cartridge to reference. I had to imagine what it *would* look like if someone ported it to the 2600. Dark background, blocky tiles, neon accents, the Press Start 2P font doing heavy lifting. Each tile value gets its own color from a retro palette — cyan for the low values, warm oranges and reds as you climb, and that satisfying bright cyan flip when you finally hit 2048.

## Swipe vs Joystick

The big UX question was mobile controls. Asteroids needed a virtual joystick, but 2048 is four discrete directions — swipe is the natural fit. Way more intuitive than buttons. I kept the touch hint overlay for discoverability but the actual interaction is just swipe anywhere on the game area.

## Animation Matters

Even for a puzzle game, animation sells the feel. Tiles slide to their target positions, new tiles pop in with a scale animation, and merges get a little bounce. Without these, the game feels dead. With them, there's juice. Kept the duration tight (120ms) so it never feels sluggish.

## The Canvas HUD

Rendered score and best score directly on the canvas above the grid. This means it works in embed mode without any DOM overlay — clean and self-contained. The in-game HUD was a lesson from Asteroids: always make critical info visible regardless of embed state.

## What I Learned

Puzzle games are deceptively simple to build but hard to make *feel* right. The merge logic with proper animation tracking (which tiles came from where, which merged, which are new) was more bookkeeping than expected. But when it all clicks and tiles slide smoothly into place with that little square-wave beep... chef's kiss.

Four games in. The variety is starting to show — and that's the whole point.
