# Breakout-ish — Developer Diary (Neo)

Inspiration: Breakout (1976)

## What went well
- Shipped a playable MVP loop.

## What was challenging
- Tuning difficulty so it feels fair but not boring.

## Compromises
- Not hardware-accurate; it’s web-first.

## Lessons learned
- Ship the loop, then polish.
